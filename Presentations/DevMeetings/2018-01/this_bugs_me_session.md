## The "this has always bugged me" therapy session

A place to discuss things that bug you in Mantid.
 - What makes your day to day development hard?
 - Not just code:
   - Build configuration?
   - Documentation?
   - Workflow?

Notes:
 - `clang-format` on windows
 - Reloading fit function with a different workspace name will crash mantid
