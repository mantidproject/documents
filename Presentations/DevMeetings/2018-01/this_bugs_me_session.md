## The "this has always bugged me" therapy session

A place to discuss things that bug you in Mantid.
 - What makes your day to day development hard?
 - Not just code:
   - Build configuration?
   - Documentation?
   - Workflow?

Notes:
 - `clang-format` on windows
 - Reloading fit function with a different workspace name will crash mantid
 - `CompareWorkspaces` can't compare identical workspaces
 - Restarting builds that have failed - unreliable tests
 - Builds that hang
 - `cmake` occaisionally fails on external projects on download stage
 - default facility on build servers shouldn't be ISIS
 - time to startup mantidplot or first time to `import mantid` in vanilla python
 - The number of branches on `mantidproject/mantid`. Ross wants forks!
 - On visual studio debug build, dealing with `QString` can be difficult
 - Interpreting `Mantid.user.properties` is everywhere
 - Mantid overwrites user properties automatically
 - An overall plan for documentation
