Agenda
======

Pinned Topics
-------------
* Review any outstanding external pull request or issues? (Owen)
* Any updates to [tracking design table](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/TSC-TrackingDesignProposals.md)? (Fede)

New Items
---------
* Update on [Maintenence tasks](/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/MaintenanceTasks.md)
* Potential Workshop topic: Unifcation of interactive-/live-/batch-reduction. At least for some instruments separate code/workflows are maintained, this adds maintenance overhead and might be worth addressing before porting more things to MPI (Simon)
* Start made on Geometry requrements [here](/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) (Owen)
* Tracking of volatile unit tests (Owen)
* [LiveListener Design](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/pull/7)(Owen)
* QA - Test documents/scripts within the codebase. It's potluck whether the unscripted test process find issues before a release. Should we have a QA section of the repository containing documents (markdown or rst) on how to test specific features? These would then have to be run through before we even go to beta testing (Martyn)
