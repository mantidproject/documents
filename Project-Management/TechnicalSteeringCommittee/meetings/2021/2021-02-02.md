New Items
---------

- Set a date for renaming `master`->`main`?

- Brief update on new mantid governance
- Brief update on [dependency handling](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/thirdparty-dependencies/Design/ThirdpartyDependencies.md)
- Review of [maintenance tasks](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/projects/15)
- Nexus API might be deprecated. Do we:
  - take ownership of it https://github.com/nexusformat/code
  - write our own API on top of HDF5
  - get rid of it, and replace by plain [HDF5 CPP](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=50073884)
  - adopt the [API from ESS](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/h5cpp)

Minutes
-------
Attendees: Fairbrother, Gigg, Hahn, Nixon, Peterson, Savici

- Brief discussion of release. Things that would stop release (all are in progress)
  - DownloadInstrument bug
  - OSX installer suffix
  - Muon gui
- Rename `master` to `main` on the first Monday after the release is announced. Currently, 2021-02-15
- When we move to a new version of `clang-format`, change the maximum line length to 119. We should also look into reducing the line length for python to 119 as well. This should wait until [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/30265) has been configured for developers.
- Mantid governance - review is writing up the results
- Dependency managment - plan is still "conda first"
- Maintenance - removing mantidplot went fine. Cleanup continues
- NeXus API discussion
  - Should start with requirements/design
  - Consensus is that we still want an abstraction on top of whatever underlying API we use
  - Step one is to take an inventory of all of the current abstractions mantid contains for accessing NeXus and where they are used
  - Underlying HDF5 library used is a separate decision because of the abstraction layer
- Sourceforge Hosting Binaries
  - Discussion shelved, as it's likely to be resolved as a side-effect of switching our dependency handling
