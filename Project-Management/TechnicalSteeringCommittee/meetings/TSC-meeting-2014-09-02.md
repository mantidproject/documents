Discussion
==========

Recommend that we look into a number of potential replacements for MantidPlot

1. Refactor/Rework of MantidPlot
2. Python type workbench (e.g. Spyder, Canopy, Anaconda, etc...)
3. Eclipse RCP based (e.g. DAWN, ICE, etc...)

Thoughts on how this fits into and provides a web based interface should be included.
