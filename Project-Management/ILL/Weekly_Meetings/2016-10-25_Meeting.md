## Meeting notes - 2016/10/25

Participants: Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Gagik Vardanyan, Antti Soininen 

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### Antti:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * NoBugs poster
 * `AutoRebin`
 * Fix issues in `CalculateFlatBackground`
 * `GetEiMonDet2` improvements
 * `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` improvements

* NoBugs poster done and delivered
* Autorebinning now has resulted in two algorithms `RebinToWidthAtX` and `RebinToMedianBinWidth`
 * BF mentioned that it is desirable to have the option not to break larger bins (as per Lamp option)
* Some further fixes to `GetEiMonDet2` based on bugs found in PR
* PR Review of isis direct inelastic sconfiguration script errors
* Thoughts on ToF GUI - based on discussion from NoBugs with Raquel
 * Idea to use `DataProcessor*` framework in Mantid
 * Has a nice widget for batch reduction
 * We should develop interface in PyQt, IB mentioned there is a long term plan for MantidPlot to become pure Python

* Work for next week:
 * `DGSReductionILL` to BF for testing
   * IN4 computer should be upgraded to IN4 before cycle starts on 4th November
 * Fix minor issues in `CalculateFlatBackground`
 * `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` improvements
 * More realistic `ComputeCalibrationCoefVan`

#### Ian:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finish design document for scanning instruments
 * NoBugs
 * `CorrectFlightPaths` bug
 * ToF Workflow for testing

* IN5 `CorrectFlightPaths` bug fixed
* Bug for file loading in Mantid dialogues fixed (`*.*` -> `*`), affects ILL ASCII files
* Scanning instrument plans
 * Plan to work with those at ESS working on instrument 2.0
 * Implement part of the Instrument 2.0 solution now, to have a long term ILL solution
 * Plan to add `DetectorInfo` class which holds position information for detectors
* Build servers - we probably need to provided an Ubuntu 14.04 build server soon as we will be the only institution using it
 * Confirmed from previous discussion with BF and talking to Stephane Armanet that Ubuntu 14.04 will be in use for a while at the ILL

* Work for next week:
 * ToF - EPP position when loading/merging
   * This should probably be fixed when merging, or loaded from file
 * Scanning intruments
  * Add info from NoBugs to design documents
  * Investigate D4, D7 and D16
 * PRs #17869 - `SpectrumInfo` and #17875 `DetectorInfo`
 * `SpectrumInfo` roll out

### IN16B:


#### Gagik:

* Initial goals for the week:
 * `FindEPP` to accept a peak range
 * `MatchPeaks` to accept 3 inputs, to compute peak shift offset for unmirror 5
 * Spectrum-wise comparisons for LAMP for all unmirror options
 * Test for `DataSelector` widget
 * Maintenance task - replace `CheckWorkspacesMatch` with `CompareWorkspaces`

* Centering options for one wing data added (mirror_sense = 16)
* Consistency cheking for mirror sense
* Background scaling factor added
* Filtering between QENS and FWS data
* Updates of documentation and release notes
* Tweaks for Flake8 (new static analysis check)
* Implemented QENS/FWS toggle in GUI
* Manual test script for `DataSelector` GUI widget PR

* Work for next week:
 * Merging of FWS branch into QENS branch
 * Contact Tilo about energy axis range
 * Detector wise comparison with Lamp -> system tests
 * Python exports for `hasMaskedBins`, `maskedBins` to allow for proper rolling and masking/unmasking appropriately

#### Verena:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Update documentation for `IndirectILLReduction` and `IndirectILLFixedWindowScans`
 * Comparison with LAMP
 * Make package of Mantid for Tilo
 * Post-processing for FWS
 * MG - amount of background to subtract

* Fixed Window Scans
 * Showed examples of FWS against temperature and time
   * Time example needs to be shown as absolute time, plot a bit odd as it goes accross the day
 * Generally agreed it looks sensible
* Mentioned work going on at ISIS for ELWIN:
 * Normalise to lowest temperature
 * Integrated elastic intensities with respect to Q
 * Elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF)
 * Mean Square Displacement (MSD): linear fit of the log (elastic intensity) data with respect to Q^2
 
* Work for next week:
 * Merging for FWS and QENS branches
 * Post-processing for FWS
 * Documentation and tests for FWS
