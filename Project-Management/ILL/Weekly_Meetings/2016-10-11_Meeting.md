## Meeting notes - 2016/10/11

Participants: Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Gagik Vardanyan 

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### Ian:

* Initial goals for the week were:

 * NoBugs talk
 * Design document for scanning instruments (also for NoBugs)

* NoBugs talk mostly finished, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/tree/master/Project-Management/ILL/NoBugs_2016_Presentations)
* Design documents for scanning instruments started
 * Took a look at the loader for D2B
 * Antti suggested looking at MergeDNS from MLZ, to see how they deal with this
* Fixed a bug introduced with the updated loader, where rosace detectors were not numbered properly
 * Also mentioned a bug in the `IN5 CorrectFlightPaths` algorithm
 * BF said `CorrectFlightPaths` should not be used for data reduction, as it is in LAMP, but could be kept for visualisation

* Work for next week:
 * Finish design document for scanning instruments
 * NoBugs
 * `CorrectFlightPaths` bug
 * ToF Workflow for testing

#### Antti:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * `AutoRebin` - to do the requested automatic rebinning
 * Fix issues with Python/C++ types for `GetEiMonDet`

* Issues in `GetEiMonDet` fixed
* `CalculateFlatBackground` now has moving window average with cyclic boundary conditions
* PR reviewed
* `ComputeCalibrationCoefVan`
 * No reliable experimental data found in papers
 * Suggestion we should switch to `ComputeCalibrationCoefVan` for the time being, with a small step
 * BF to look at best approximation to use
 * BF - potential to conduct an experiment at ILL in November
 * MG mentioned it would be good to make sure this data is easily accessible

* Work for next week:
 * NoBugs poster
 * `AutoRebin`
 * Fix issues in `CalculateFlatBackground`
 * `GetEiMonDet2` improvements
 * `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` improvements

#### Bjorn:

Had some questionts about instrument deviations, and verification. Antti and Ian explained how the IDFs are defined, with a shape in a particular orientation first defined, and rotations and translations then applied to it. Also the instrument view was demonstrated, with options to choose ToF range of data shown, and for a spherical instrument projection.

BF to follow up with Marek about upper and lower bank angles for IN6.

### IN16B:

#### Verena:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Try FWS with other data
 * Further modifications and requirements to be defined

* Fixed Window Scans
 * Inputs such as background and calibration onw accepted
 * Output group workspaces for each doppler energy
 * Some changes to `IndirectILLReduction`
  * Normalise to monitor for each case (QENS, elastic, inelastic, FWS)
  * Some merge conflicts now arising form this
 * Implementation using Python regular expressions
 * Error shown if no-fixed window scan
 * Comparison with LAMP started
 
* Work for next week:
 * Update documentation for `IndirectILLReduction` and `IndirectILLFixedWindowScans`
 * Comparison with LAMP
 * Make package of Mantid for Tilo
 * Post-processing for FWS
 * MG - amount of background to subtract

#### Gagik:

* Initial goals for the week:
 * Test for `DataSelector` widget
 * Look into absorption corrections?
 * Spectrum-wise comparisons with Lamp
 * Tidy up code in algorithm

* `MultipleFileProperty` `OptionalLoad` completed
* Bug with saving/loading masking fixed
* GUI adjustments for FWS done
* Vanadium, background now support multiple file property
* Some issues found with `FindEPP`
 * It is based on an initial guess of 3 x FWHM around the max
 * This can result in the whole range being selected
 * This fits the whole range, including asymmetrical part
 * Need to control this

* Work for next week:
 * `FindEPP` to accept a peak range
 * `MatchPeaks` to accept 3 inputs, to compute peak shift offset for unmirror 5
* Spectrum-wise comparisons for LAMP for all unmirror options
* Test for `DataSelector` widget
* Maintenance task - replace `CheckWorkspacesMatch` with `CompareWorkspaces`
