## Meeting notes - 2017/02/20

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Gabriel Cuello, Thomas Hansen, Paolo Mutti

### Gagik - Diffraction Work

See the [presentation](2017-02-20-Diffraction.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * N/A - first meeting!

Gagik gave an overview of Mantid for the benefit of GC and TH:
 * Mantid is a C++ framework, with a full Python API.
 * Users can easily define their own algorithms and plug in.
 * Workspaces a high-level data structures with associated meta-data - most of use a `MatrixWorkspace` - an array of 1D histograms
 * Instrument is linked to workspace via an IDF (XML instrument schema)
 * Algorithms are the vebs - maniuplate workspaces 
 * An oveview of the GUI was shown, with the log shell, workspace browser, workspace matrix view, plotting window, algorithm list, Python shell, Python script editor, custom interface and instrument view

Progress:
 * Instrument Definitions:
  * D2B - already existed, but monitor is missing
  * D1B - now implemented, L1 distance and monitor positions still outstanding
  * D4 - Now implemented, again L1 and monitor positions still outstanding
  * D20 - Now implemented, but cells can be virtually split into 2/3 by the DAE
    * Will need to create alternative definitions to support these
    * PM - should only be using one, not regularly changed
    * TH - Currently not using the splitting, expect to virtually split into 2 or 3 though
 * `LoadILLDiffraction` - new NeXus files produced last week, sample files provided by Franck Cecillon
  * Scanned data stored into one block in a NeXus entry - not officiial NeXus
  * We are able to read these files into Mantid, but will be easier if the data block has a `NX_class` attribute

Work for next sprint:
 * Finalise the IDFs, merge into Mantid
 * Work on `LoadILLDiffraction`, will require some real data file
 * Decide on best way to deal with scans, one/multiple workspaces etc. TH and GC said that detector moves would need to be in one workspace (as planned), other scans are used more flexibly.
 * Implement scanning detectors in loader for D2B (IB)
 * Discuss reduction workflow in next meeting - we will start with powder diffraction

### Ian - Instruments with Moving Detectors

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * SpectrumInfo/DetectorInfo rollout - keep track of progress and PR reviews
 * Investigate use of `Eigen` library
 * Meeting with Simon and Owen next week - should make plans for next few weeks after this

Progress:
 * Ian gave a brief overview of the changes in Mantid for scanning detectors
 * D2B will make a good test case for this - as a high resolution instrument
  * TH mentioned that multiple scans can be performed, so it might be expected to have 128 x 256 x 25 x 10 points in a single workspace (~8 million points)
  * Should soon be able to test with the powder reduction workflow
 * Experimental code branch to move positions and rotations under review
 * Some algorithms could still require further updates after this, most should not

Work for next sprint:
 * Finish final SpectrumInfo/DetectorInfo changes to support PR for position and rotation moves
 * Review position/rotation moves work
 * Extend `LoadILLDiffraction` to support D2B scans
 * Saving/Loading of new NeXus format from Mantid
