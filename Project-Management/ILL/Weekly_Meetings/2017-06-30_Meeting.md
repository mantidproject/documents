## Meeting notes - 2017/06/30 - D20 Meeting

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Gagik Vardanyan, Franck Cecillon, Miguel Gonzalez, Thomas Hansen

### Gagik - D20 Update

Gagik provided a demo of the current state of ILL powder diffraction.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Finalise the IDFs, merge into Mantid
 * Work on `LoadILLDiffraction`, will require some real data file
 * Decide on best way to deal with scans, one/multiple workspaces etc. TH and GC said that detector moves would need to be in one workspace (as planned), other scans are used more flexibly.
 * Implement scanning detectors in loader for D2B (IB)
 * Discuss reduction workflow in next meeting - we will start with powder diffraction

 * An initial reduction algorithm exists for D20, `PowderILLDiffraction`.
 * Currently there are two converted data sets for testing, covering a temperature scan and two wavelengths
 * Normalisation
  * TH requested a no normalisation option
  * Default might need to be instrument specific
 * Region-of-Interest
  * 2&theta; range is the normal case
  * Should be able to supply different ranges, e.g. comma separated ranges
  * Could be a requirement for giving range of detector IDs too
 * Observable - TH would like some sensible defaults set (e.g. Temperature -> sample.temperature, Pressure -> sample.pressure), plus free option
 * TH would like to be easily change the x-axis, possibly including calculation that rely on metadata
  * Manually changing the X-axis via Python should be straightforward
 * X-axis normally would be in 2&theata;, and then converted to Q-spacing if required (e.g. for D4). dSpacing not so common, but could be useful, the same for pixel number.
 * 2&theta; angles should be negative for detectors that are the other side of the incoming beam direction.
  * This can be used to see the beam stop
  * Would normally truncate this later
  * The 2&theta; position can be offset, needs calibrating for wavelength and shift
 * Calibration appears to be good at first look
 * GV asked about excluding bad detectors
  * Normally should be excluded, and this is the case for Fullprof
  * These can be masked in Mantid
  * For GSAS the format specifies fixed distances between cells, so the zero counting cells are required
  * Should be possible to interpolate in the saving routine
 * TH mentioned that he would like 3D graphs, but matplotlib does not provide this
 * Calibration application is done in a separate algorithm
  * To generate the calibration file is a little involved
  * GV and TH to meet to discuss how to do this
  * IDL script exists but is not documented
 * ROC correction
  * Effectively a second calibration file
  * Easy to generate, an isotropic scatterer is used and workspaces divided to obtain correction
  * TH to provide example numors for ROC
 * Fullprof format number 10 is required
  * Contains x, y, sigma
  * One file per temperature, can add temperature as a comment
  * Naming should be a base name + a numor
  * Always in units of scattering angle
 * TH to start testing Mantid
  * GV to provide a Mac build
  * NeXus files are on network drive
 * MG asked about background/vanadium corrections
  * TH mentioned this is normally done interactively, to find the best background
 * TH asked about the script history
  * Full history is available in Mantid
  * This is saved in Mantid NeXus files
  * Can be copied into a Python script to replay the history 

Work for next sprint:
 * Calibration calculation
 * Verification and updates for saving to GSAS and Fullprof
 * Work on workflow algorithm to address points mentioned
  * ROI options
  * Normalisation options
  * Choice of observable
  * ...
