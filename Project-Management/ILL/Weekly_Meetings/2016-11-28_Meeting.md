## Backscattering and Future Planning

## Meeting notes - 2016/11/28

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Gagik Vardanyan, Thomas Saerbeck

### Reflecometry Script Example:

IB showed demo of [script adapted from Ricardo](../Reflectometry_Scripts.md)

### Requirements Document:

IB went through document showing some initial ideas of what is/is not in Mantid for Reflecometry. See [Reflecometry ToF Requirements and Mantid](../Reflectometry/Reflectometry_ToF_Requirements_and_Mantid.md).

Below are some notes on the discussion.

* **Read input**
 * TS mentioned problems with IDFs for ISIS instrument scientists
   * Problem seems to be with defining absolute positions for pixels vs defining an array
   * IB said it should be possible to define the array with absolute positions
 * Question about whether the data would be 2D/3D
   * For ToF currently integrated in one detector direction
   * Possible that the full, unintegrated data will be used routinely in the future, but this will not be until next year
 * Mentioned that IDFs can be updated from GitHub by anyone
   * This might be related to using the script repository in Mantid, which can also contain IDFs anyone can change

* **Find regions of interest**
 * At ILL will always need to search for the beam as it will not be on same detector each run
 * Can have asymmetrical beams so need to be able to specify width

* **Background**
 * Not taken into account at ISIS
 * Always needs user input to define ROI for the data

* **Average data at similar XY coordinates**
 * Generally not required for ToF
 * Sometimes have two measurements for the same parameters, but in this case can sum the data

* **Gravity corrections**
 * These are required for all ISIS instruments
 * Instrument scientists at ISIS have their own corrections - not in Mantid
 * Polarisation - would like to keep the corrections from Wildes, as opposed to the ones used at ISIS. Implementation should be straightforward.

* **Polarisation corrections**
 * This should be based on paper by Wildes - will probably be an alternative algorithm to the one used at ISIS

* **Calculate Resolutions**
 * This can be determined from choppers and slit widths - will be likely different for ILL to what is used at ISIS

* **Final normalisation and join**
 * `Stitch1D` may not be required

* **GUI**
 * TS mentioned that some aspects of the interface are not so nice, for example difficult to quickly find how to save a file as ASCII
 * Error output should be human readable
 * COSMOS has an extra tab for the logging, and warnings are listed separately to make them clear
 * Looked at the ISIS reflectometry (polref) interface - generally this has potential
 * TS also liked the ability to search for files to auto-populate the table

* **Workflow**
 * TS suggested that the ISIS workflow should be similar to the ILL workflow in principle
 * ISIS workflow is in C++, so we need to make a decision on using that, or creating a new Python algorithm
 * Try to avoid using the script repository due to problems TS mentioned

* **COSMOS**
 * MG demoed the COSMOS GUI
 * The tabbed could serve as a basis for what we need
 * Tabs for various settings, and settings can be saved
 * Many values obtained straight from NeXus file, but can be overridden (under MACHINE tab) 
   * Useful if there has been a problem with recording data during run
   * Might also want option to override this
