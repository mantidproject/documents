## Meeting notes - 2017/10/23 - Powder Diffraction Meeting

Participants: Ian Bush, Gagik Vardanyan, Franck Cecillon, Miguel Gonzalez, Thomas Hansen, Gabriel Cuello, Antti Soininen

### Ian - D2B Update

See the [presentation](2017-10-23-D2B.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals were:
 * `SumOverlappingTubes`
   * Work needed for error propagation, progress and documentation
 * Normalisation
   * `NormaliseToMonitor` requires detector scan support - now there is more than one monitor
 * D2B Calibration
   * Will need to adapt loader once we have the calibrated D2B files
   * Check calibrated results against Lamp
   * Generation of calibration files will need to be discussed - done differently on all four powder diffraction instruments

Current progress:
 * `NormaliseToMonitor`
   * Changes to support workspaces with single counts (no ToF axis)
   * Changes to support detector scan workspaces
   * Otherwise unchanged, with some internal tidy-up
   * Reviewed, awaiting merge to master
 * D2B loader
   * Can load raw or calibrated data in Mantid
   * Discrepancy between Mantid and Lamp of a few counts, needs investigating
   * Calibrated data shows a bigger systematic difference as expected with the different interpolation done in the NeXus files, compared with Lamp
 * Discussed whether the tube interpolation should be done or, masking performed in Mantid
   * Leave zeros in and mask, or count them?
   * FC also explained a height adjustment is performed to line the tubes up
   * Agreed to keep interpolation as it is
 * Discussed whether data in NeXus files should be floats or integers
   * FC - some jitter is added on counts that could be rounded up or down, to avoid issues in workspaces with low counts
   * FC to provide example files with floats so a comparison of differences can be made
 * 2D straight option added
   * GC to discuss with Emanulle if the texture options are required

Work to do:
 * `SumOverlappingTubes`
   * 1D option for final diffractogram
   * Error propogation
   * Unit tests for new features
   * Documentation
 * Loader
   * Finalise calibrated data loading
 * D2B workflow algorithm
 * Calibration - apply from files

### Gagik - D20 Update

See the [presentation](2017-10-23-D20.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals were:
* Finalise D20 calibration
* Build a package so TH can test
* Code cleanup and optimisation
* Unit testing and system testing
* Documentation and usage examples
* GSAS export
  * Can Mantid `SaveGSS` algorithm help?
  * Need to figure exat format required
* ROC correction - data required
* Omega Scan - data required
* D1B testing - data required

Current progress:
* Most likely mean method for D20 calibration
  * General purpose in C++
  * Now owkrs in ~2 min
* Package built for TH to test
* Treatment of zero counting cells for leace, crop and interpolate
* Rebin in temperature axis
* Header fixed in Fullprof Mantid save algoirthm
* GSAS saving algorithm generalised
* Unit tests and docmenation added
* GV showed a temperature binning example using rebin
 * Question about how to take mean from cenntre of bin
* Detector scan example will be similar to calibration algorithm
* GV - ROI normalisation, how to define a single region for all the cells?
* GV rebinning in scan axis, what to do about bin-widths?
* ROC correction should this be a function of cell number of 2&theta;?

TH testing:
* Need some extra help generally to get to grips with the basics, plotting etc.
* Some problems with crashing, then taking a long time to restart
  * GV same problems for Tilo, some problem with unstable build
* Can algorithms run in parallel?
  * Yes, fully supported in Mantid

Work to do:
* Testing and validation of GSAS and Fullprof saving
* ROC corrections
* Tetsing with omega and other scans - need data converted for this
* Complete tests and documentation
* Implement detector scan reduction
* Test with D1B data
