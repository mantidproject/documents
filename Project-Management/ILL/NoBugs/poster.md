### Data Reduction at the ILL: A Comparison Between Mantid and Lamp

#### Antti Sonien, Gagik Vardanyan, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund

At the ILL Mantid is being introduced for neutron data reduction, with a view to eventually replace the existing Lamp software. We present some work discussing the differences and similarities in approach between Lamp and Mantid, and a comparison of data reduction treatments for Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy and Backscattering data. We will also discuss some of the changes required in Mantid to allow like-for-like comparisons to be made.
