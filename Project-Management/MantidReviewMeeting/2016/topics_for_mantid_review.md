# Topics for the Mantid Review Meeting

**Add topics here which you want to see discussed, explained or answered in the Mantid review meeting.**

* ISIS Specific: What is `vms_compat` and where can we find a clear definition for it?
* WorkspaceGroups:  "*...wondering how does grouping workspaces actually work, what does grouping do, is it just syntactic interface sugar or does it make actual changes in how workspaces are accessed/handled/stored/processed, as I’ve seen workspace groups being specially handled in some algorithms.*"
