* ORNL - Granroth, Peterson, Proffen, Leal
* ISIS - Draper, Greenfield, Pascal, Griffin, Cottrell

## Topics

1. Changes to the PMB
    - ISIS: Griffin will substitute Greenfield in her absence.

3. Actions
    - Powder diffraction training material (Granroth)
        - The training material was swapped with direct geoometry spectometer and will be availble in the form of notebooks in August.
    - ILL Indirect Geometry:
      - May be changes are needed to the geometry / IDF. Check again next PMB meeting.
    - Mantid core team and long term plan (Taylor)
        - Small teams will be formed at all the institutes to form a Core Team.
        - The Core team will begin with a startup meeting in September.
        - The team should present a proposal on the first item considered to the next PMB.
        - The proposal shoud include what needs to be done (e.g. for Mantid as a Scipy style library), benefits, risks, resources and time scales.
        - Some discussion involved:
            - Peter Peterson raised the question should the driection be Pyton core + `C++` vs `C++` core with Python bindings - this could be considered by the core team but no specific direction was decided.
            - Involve scientists that have used the Python API and have gone through some fustrations using it.
            - Scientist should review the first draft design
            - The new framework should be much easier to develop into.
            - Contributing to the framework should be easy.
        - The guiding principle decided was:
            - Not a totally loose guideline for the core team.
            - The team should focus on the Scipy style library and workspaces from the Mantid 5 year plan
            - Focus on the performance and stability

7. Facility updates / news 
    - SNS: Powergen is comming soon and will need a new IDF.
    - ILL: The ILL has finished developments for ToF Spectroscopy, as well as Back Scattering.

10. Scientific steering committee discussion
    - The feedback from the users workshop:
        - Users provide a different perspective
        - Need to decide what Mantid does: Reduction and Analysis vs just reduction?
        - It is necessary to have face to face conversations with external users.
        - Organise a PMB meeting within that week.
        - Action:
            - Each facility need to come up with a list of users per area of expertise and share with the PMB by September.
